## Hello world!

I’ve been into web development for a while now and I must say, I’m enjoying every bit of it. Few day ago, I was redesigning my portfolio and decided to integrate a blog into it.
My reasons for this includes:

- To improve my online presence
- To share what I know with the world
- To improve my writing skills

## What I hope to share

In this blog I will be posting about:

- My progress in tech
- Some of my works/projects
- Tool stacks
- Interesting hacks I discover
- Some pitfalls I fall into and how I solve them
